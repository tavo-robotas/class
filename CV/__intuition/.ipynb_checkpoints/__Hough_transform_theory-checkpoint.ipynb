    " They are basically gradient computation which is a vector of gradient magnitude and direction and all three uses gradient magnitude and if the magnitude is higher then that's the edge. And these are pixel wise. H - pixel, \n",
    " \n",
    "Similarly more sophisticated edge detectors like Laplacian of Gaussian which looks at the second derivative Gaussian and just (smoothing by gaussian and zero crossings) in that that's better detector and then canny edge detector which looks a at the gradient of the Gaussian which imply the magnitude as weel as the direction\n",
