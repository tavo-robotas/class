    "we can tell that this is context manager because of <code>**with**</code> statement. The one thing that you can notice is that we don't need to remember to close down the file after we're done working with it and not only that but it is also recommended because if we throw an error working with this file then it's still going to get closed properly and that is why context managers are so usefull. It handles the teardown of the resources for us so we don't have to remember to do it and the more that is handled for us automatically the better. It's great for file but as well for other resources , for example we can use this to <code>**connect and close connection to database**</code> we can <code>**aquire and release locks**</code>,  <code>**open and close serial communication**</code> etc. There are plenty of usefull casse that you will find down the learning road."

There couple a ways we can achieve this either by using <code>**class**</code> or by using a function with <code>**decorator**</code>. For class refer to <code>**__OOP**</code> and for decorator to <code>**__decorators**</code> lesson notebooks. To start off lets replicate the functionality of context manager when opening a file and automatically closing it when we're done with it by creating a class. This way will show more clearly what's going on."
