    "Good thing about this code is that it’s easy. It's easy to write and debug and also more simple to think about it. There’s only one \"train of thought\" running through it, so you can predict what the next step is going to be and how it will behave. The bad problem here is that it’s relatively slow. Being slower isn’t always a  issue. If the program you’re running takes only 2 seconds with a synchronous version and is only run rarely, it’s probably not worth adding concurrency at all."
